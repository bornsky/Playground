/*
We consider the sum of an array of integers to be the sum of its individual elements. For example, if the array is numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4], the sum of the array is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
 
Complete the summation function in the editor. It has 1 parameter: an array of n integers, numbers. It must return an integer denoting the sum of numbers' elements.
 
Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the numbers array.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) defines integer i in numbers.
 
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 104
1 ≤ numbersi ≤ 104, where numbersi is element i in numbers and 0 ≤ i < n.
 
Output Format
The function must return an integer denoting the sum of all the elements in numbers. This is printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

5
 
Sample Output 0
15
 
Explanation 0
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, so the function returns 15.

Sample Output 1
24
 
Explanation 1
12 + 12 = 24, so the function returns 24.
