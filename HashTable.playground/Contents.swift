/*
    Hashtables combine random access with ability with array
    with the dynamism of a linked list.
- A "Hash Function" will get back a given key for an value
- Hashtables insert, search and delete items in the array using "Big O notation Î˜(n)"
- Hashtables have a key and values
- "Collusion" occurs when a value is already located in a area that the new item is suppose
  to be placed. "Linear probing" then takes place which places the new item in the next opened
  key.
- Cons to this is that when all keys are filled we then get close to what is known as
  clustering which then causes theta(constant). This could lead to infinite loop.
 * To solve this problem we use "Absolute chaining". This uses linked listed to add extra links to 
    keys for certain values.
